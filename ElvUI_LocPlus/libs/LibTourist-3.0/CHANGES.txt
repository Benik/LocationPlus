=================
*** IMPORTANT ***
=================

Blizzard has completely removed the old World Map API to replace it by the new C_Map API. 
Besides that, all mapID's have been reassigned.

LibTourist has been adapted to use the new C_Map interface, but there are some limitations.


YARDS

The C_Map API does not seem to return any data expressed in yards.
This causes the following LibTourist API functions to be currently BROKEN:

- GetZoneYardSize
- GetZoneYardOffset
- GetYardDistance
- TransposeZoneCoordinate
- GetBestZoneCoordinate

These methods are still part of the LibTourist API but return nil values because zone sizes and offsets in yards can no longer be calculated.
If this can't be replaced by new functionality, the functions will eventually be removed from LibTourist.


TEXTURE NAMES

I haven't found the texture name in the C_Map interface yet, so for now the new uiMapArtID is used instead.
The following LibTourist functions should work, but ONLY if a uiMapArtID is passed as parameter:

- GetZoneMapIDFromTexture
- GetZoneFromTexture
- GetEnglishZoneFromTexture

The uiMapArtID can be retrieved using C_Map.GetMapArtID.
This part of the functionality is still to be revised.


ALL OTHER FUNCTIONALITY 

...should be working, though I am currently unable to properly test it.
In this version, TRACING is turned ON (can be disabled by commenting line 29).

=================



TOC
---

TOC version set to 80000.


API CHANGES
-----------

In addition to the API changes mentioned above:

- GetMapContinentsAlt
now returns the new uiMapID as key in the return collection instead of the continent index that was used for SetMapZoom (which has been removed)

- GetMapZonesAlt
now returns the new uiMapID as key in the return collection instead of the zone index that was used for SetMapZoom (which has been removed)

- GetMapNameByIDAlt
now expects a uiMapID as parameter

- added 8 missing map ID's to lookup table.
- updated all level ranges for zones (and dungeons/complexes) that now scale to the player's level.
- API: function GetLegionZoneLevel has been removed, use GetScaledZoneLevel instead.
- API: added function GetScaledZoneLevel(zone) - returns the player level if player level is  between min and max zone level, otherwise returns min or max zone level.
- API: function GetLevel: added a third return value. Now returns high, low and scaled level. Returns nil for 'scaled' if not applicable, otherwise uses GetScaledZoneLevel to calculate it.
- API: function GetLevelColor: For scaled zones the level color is not determined by the zone's minimum and maximum level, but by it's scaled level (calculated by GetScaledZoneLevel).
- API: IterateRecommendedZones: the list recommended zones is now based on the scaled level of the zones, as calculated by GetScaledZoneLevel.
- API: function GetLevelString: the format for the level string of a scaling zone is now "<scaled level> (<minimum level>-<maximum level>)".

Note: not all min and max zone levels have been verified, please let me know if values are incorrect.
