- added 38 mapIDs
- added 6 flight nodes
- added zone Nazjatar (continent = Azeroth)
- added zone Mechagon Island
- added dungeon Mechagon
- added raid The Eternal Palace
- updated TOC to 80200

Note: even though there appears to be a continent map for Nazjatar (ID 1504) this map has no parent map and no children. Also, Nazjatar does not appear in the list of continents provided by C_Map. However, the Nazjatar zone map (ID 1355) has the Azeroth map (947) as parent. So now Azeroth has a bunch of continents and one zone as children. Had to make some exceptions to make that work, like processing Azeroth as if it were a continent in order to initialize the Nazjatar zone data.
