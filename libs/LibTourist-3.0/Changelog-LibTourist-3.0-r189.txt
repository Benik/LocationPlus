Forgot to test the level fix for Suramar and - of course - I missed something... Should work now.

- level for Sarumar no longer scales with player level but is fixed at 110
- added values for offset and scale for The Broken Isles to avoid errors

KNOWN ISSUE: Currently, cross-zone and cross-continent distance calculations appear to be inaccurate or  incorrect. This mechanism will have to be revised completely. However, distance calculations within a zone are correct.

Bugfix: repaired the mechanism that sets the player level for the six Legion zones. Cached values were empty because they were initialized before the player level was known. Values should now also be updated when the player levels up during play.
